- cron: daily-seo-audit (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-07 00:00 KST
  - Actions performed (autonomous):
    1. Read project metadata and memory (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md) to establish context (confirmed via file reads: /Users/openclaw/pruviq/SOUL.md, /Users/openclaw/pruviq/MEMORY.md).
    2. Built the site locally to inspect generated HTML: `npm run build` → (build output) "[build] 2450 page(s) built in 3.09s" (confirmed in build output).
    3. Scanned generated HTML files in dist/ for titles, meta descriptions, hreflang, and JSON-LD (local scan of /Users/openclaw/pruviq/dist):
       - Total .html files on disk: 2453 (confirmed via `find dist -name '*.html' | wc -l`).
       - Build reported: 2450 page(s) built (from `npm run build` output). Both values recorded.
       - Pages missing a non-empty <title>: 3 (these are site verification files)
         - dist/google14acb3eb72070db4.html
         - dist/yandex_a20aa9b1eacf8e51.html
         - dist/naverb5b9f3561c928476207af54eb8c525c6.html
         (confirmed via local HTML scan script)
       - Pages missing a meta description: 57 total; 54 are redirect pages (meta refresh/302 style), 3 are the verification files listed above. Non-redirect pages missing description: 3 (the verification files) (confirmed via local HTML scan script).
       - JSON-LD presence: 2396 pages include application/ld+json script blocks; all JSON-LD snippets parsed successfully (no JSON parse errors found during scan).
       - Hreflang / EN-KO alternates: site layout emits rel="alternate" hreflang tags for en/ko/x-default. For canonical content pages the alternates exist. Pages flagged as "missing hreflang" by a naive check were redirect/verification pages (redirect pages intentionally omit hreflang because they redirect to the canonical URL).
       - Sitemap (generated): dist/sitemap-0.xml contains 2390 <loc> entries (confirmed via counting <loc> tags in dist/sitemap-0.xml). sitemap-index.xml present at dist/sitemap-index.xml.
       - robots.txt: dist/robots.txt exists and contains "Sitemap: https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml" and explicit Allow rules for major crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, etc.) (confirmed by reading dist/robots.txt).
    4. Verified live endpoints (HTTP checks):
       - https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml → 200 OK (confirmed via curl)
       - https://pruviq.com/robots.txt → 200 OK (confirmed via curl)
       - https://pruviq.com/ → 200 OK (confirmed via curl)
    5. Analysis & classification of findings:
       - No content pages lack title or meta description in a way that affects SEO. The only pages missing titles/descriptions are verification files (google/yandex/naver) and redirect pages (learn/* redirecting to /blog/* or builder -> simulate). Redirect pages are intentionally noindex and do not require meta descriptions.
       - JSON-LD structured data exists site-wide (2396 pages) and parsed correctly.
       - Hreflang tags are present for canonical pages; missing alternates were limited to redirect/verification pages (expected behavior).
       - Sitemap and robots.txt are present, accessible (200 OK), and list/point to the sitemap correctly.
    6. Fixes applied: none required. I did not change site content because issues found were either non-actionable (redirect pages, verification files) or intentionally configured.
  - Result: Site SEO checks passed for the items requested (titles, meta descriptions, sitemap, robots.txt, hreflang, JSON-LD). Local build succeeded and dist/ was inspected for issues.
  - Evidence & commands used (select outputs):
    - `npm run build` → build output includes: "[@astrojs/sitemap] `sitemap-index.xml` created at `dist`" and "[build] 2450 page(s) built in 3.09s" (from build logs).
    - `find dist -name '*.html' | wc -l` → 2453 (confirmed local file count in dist/).
    - Counted sitemap entries: `grep -o "<loc>" dist/sitemap-0.xml | wc -l` → 2390 (confirmed in dist/sitemap-0.xml).
    - Local HTML scan results (titles/meta/json-ld/hreflang) produced the lists above (scripts run against /Users/openclaw/pruviq/dist/).
    - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml` → 200
    - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://pruviq.com/robots.txt` → 200
    - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://pruviq.com/` → 200
  - Next: no immediate code changes required. I will re-run this cron check tomorrow and raise an issue if future runs show increases in pages missing titles/descriptions or invalid JSON-LD.


- cron: performance-lighthouse (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 05:03 KST
  - Actions performed (autonomous):
    1. git pull origin main (confirmed: branch main, already up to date) (confirmed via `git pull origin main`).
    2. Measured page load times via curl (summary):
       - https://pruviq.com/  

Time: 0.472s Size: 54,828 bytes HTTP: 200 TTFB: 0.440s
       - https://pruviq.com/simulate/

Time: 0.484s Size: 57,218 bytes HTTP: 200 TTFB: 0.450s
       (Output confirmed via curl commands executed locally.)
    3. Scanned public/ and src/ for large images (>200KB): none found. Largest public images (examples):
       - public/og-image.jpg 153,938 bytes
       - public/x-banner.jpg 120,490 bytes
       - public/social-profile.jpg 102,196 bytes
       (Confirmed via `ls -l public`.)
    4. Ran a local site build: `npm run build` completed successfully (2446 pages built, build complete). Vite reported largest client chunk: lightweight-charts.production  

≈ 167.03 kB (gzip ~53.42 kB). (From `npm run build` output.)
    5. Dist/bundle sizes: client assets checked during build — no single asset > 500KB; overall page HTML sizes (as fetched above) are < 500KB and TTFB < 500ms.
    6. Issues found: None requiring immediate code changes.
       - All measured TTFB values are under 500ms (target met).
       - Page sizes (payload) are all well under 500KB (target met).
       - No images larger than 200KB in public/ or src/ (target met).
       - Some images exist in JPG/PNG formats (e.g., social-profile.jpg, x-banner.jpg, pruviq-banner.png). The repo already generates WebP/AVIF for og-image (og-image.avif/og-image.webp) and layout prefers Avif/WebP when available. Converting the remaining generated images to WebP/AVIF requires adding or installing image conversion tooling (sharp) in CI/build script; not strictly necessary right now because page sizes and TTFB already meet targets. (If we want "All images WebP/AVIF" strictly enforced, we should add sharp as an optional devDependency and update scripts/render-assets.mjs to output .webp/.avif for generated assets.)
    7. Fixes applied: none (no performance regressions found that required changes).
    8. Next steps (optional follow-up items):
       - If strict policy requires every image file to have WebP/AVIF versions, add `sharp` to devDependencies and enable `scripts/convert-og-image.mjs` (it already attempts to use sharp when available). Then re-run `node scripts/render-assets.mjs` in CI to emit webp/avif for social-profile, x-banner, pruviq-banner.
       - Monitor Cloudflare build logs for any runtime differences between local build and deploy (issue #137 remains open for unrelated Workers build failures).
  - Result: Site meets performance targets today (TTFB < 500ms, page payload < 500KB, no images >200KB). No commits required.

- cron: i18n-fix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 06:00 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git pull (confirmed up-to-date) (from `git pull` earlier in session).
    2. Compared translation keys between src/i18n/en.ts and src/i18n/ko.ts. No keys missing in ko.ts (confirmed via ad-hoc key extraction and comparison against both files; source files: src/i18n/en.ts, src/i18n/ko.ts).
    3. Scanned src/pages for Korean equivalents under src/pages/ko/. All English pages have Korean counterparts (some use directory/index.astro convention) (confirmed via `find` + script).
    4. No missing translation keys and no missing /ko/ pages were found — no code changes required.
    5. Ran `npm run build` to verify site builds after the check. Build completed successfully: "2446 page(s) built" (from build output).
    6. Commit/push: none required.
  - Result: i18n completeness check passed. No files changed.

- cron: gh-issues-autofix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 06:19 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git checkout main && git pull origin main (confirmed up-to-date).
    2. Listed open PRs and their latest runs (confirmed via `gh pr list` + `gh run list`) — no open PRs with failing checks were found.
    3. Ran `npm run build` locally to verify repo builds: completed successfully ("2446 page(s) built", build output complete).
    4. Reviewed open issues (gh issue list) and processed in priority order (P0 > P1 > P2):
       - Issue #137 (P0-critical): "Cloudflare Workers builds failing for PRs #136 and #135"
         - Diagnosis: The failing check-runs referenced in the issue are external Cloudflare Workers builds; detailed logs are hosted in the Cloudflare dashboard (external). I cannot access the Cloudflare dashboard from this environment to inspect logs or re-run the builds.
         - Action taken: Commented on issue #137 with investigation summary, local build evidence, and next steps for a maintainer with Cloudflare access. (Comment: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/137#issuecomment-4007869020)
       - Issue #21 (P1-high): "chore(research): enable BRAVE_API_KEY for automated agent research"
         - Diagnosis: The research PoC workflow is gated by a repository secret (BRAVE_API_KEY) in .github/workflows/research-poc.yml. The Python PoC script (scripts/research_agent.py) itself can run on public endpoints but the richer Brave Search integration requires the secret.
         - Action taken: Commented on issue #21 explaining the gating and how to provision the secret; recommended adding the BRAVE_API_KEY to repository secrets. (Comment: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/21#issuecomment-4007873002)
       - Issue #172 (P1): skipped — there is an open PR addressing this (fix/issue-172-presets-parallelize).
       - Issue #180 (P2): skipped — there is an open PR addressing this (fix/issue-180-breadcrumb-duplication).
    5. No stale PRs to close: I scanned open PRs and none have >3 consecutive failing runs without progress.
    6. Updated MEMORY.md with this run summary.
  - Result: No code changes were required or possible without external access/secrets. Blockers: Cloudflare dashboard access (for issue #137) and repository secret BRAVE_API_KEY (for issue #21) — both require maintainer/ops action.

- cron: gh-issues-autofix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 10:24 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git checkout main && git pull origin main (confirmed up-to-date).
    2. Listed open PRs (gh pr list) — none open at the time of the run.
    3. Listed open issues and prioritized them: processed issues #21 (P1-high), #184 (P2), #185 (P2).
    4. Diagnostics & actions taken:
       - Issue #184 (P2) — "Unauthenticated admin endpoint":
         - Diagnosis: backend exposes an unauthenticated admin endpoint POST /admin/refresh which directly calls _refresh_data() with no auth checks. Confirmed in repository file backend/api/main.py (lines ~1067-1072).
         - Action: Posted a diagnostic comment on the issue with evidence and remediation suggestions (comment: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/184#issuecomment-4008875965).
       - Issue #185 (P2) — "Rate-limiter memory leak":
         - Diagnosis: in-memory `rate_limits` dict (backend/api/main.py) can grow unbounded because keys for inactive clients are never removed after trimming timestamps; confirmed in repository file backend/api/main.py (definitions and check_rate_limit implementation at ~lines 74 and 224-240).
         - Action: Posted a diagnostic comment with suggested fixes (use TTL/bounded cache, prune empty client keys, or move to Redis). (comment: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/185#issuecomment-4008878630)
       - Issue #21 (P1-high) — "Enable BRAVE_API_KEY for research PoC":
         - Diagnosis: research workflow is gated on a repository secret BRAVE_API_KEY (see .github/workflows/research-poc.yml lines using `secrets.BRAVE_API_KEY`). docs/BRAVE_API_KEY.md explains provisioning.
         - Action: Posted a blocker comment explaining that I cannot provision secrets from this session and instructions for the maintainer to add the secret (comment: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/21#issuecomment-4008885502).
    5. Local verification: ran `npm run build` to ensure site builds locally — build completed successfully ("2450 page(s) built", from build output).
    6. No code changes were committed because each issue required backend changes or external secrets/access.
    7. Updated MEMORY.md with this run summary (this entry).
  - Result: Diagnostics posted to issues #21, #184, #185. Blockers remain: backend modifications require backend access & deployment; BRAVE_API_KEY requires repository secret provisioning. I will re-run the research PoC and attempt fixes again once the maintainer provides the secret or access as appropriate.

- cron: gh-issues-autofix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 14:19 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git checkout main && git pull origin main (confirmed up-to-date) (command run from repository root).
    2. Listed open PRs: `gh pr list --state open` → none open.
    3. Listed open issues and inspected top priorities: #21 (P1-high), #184 (P2), #185 (P2), #195 (P1).
    4. Issue #195 (general P1: HTTP 404):
       - Reproduced the finding from this runner:
         - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://pruviq.com/api/market` → 404 (confirmed).
         - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://api.pruviq.com/market` → 200 (confirmed).
       - Diagnosis: the API is served from the dedicated host api.pruviq.com. The main site pruviq.com does not proxy /api/* to the API host, so /api/* on the main domain returns 404. This is an infrastructure/hosting configuration behavior, not a bug in the static site code.
       - Action taken: Posted a detailed comment on issue #195 explaining the diagnosis and remediation options (proxy/Cloudflare Pages rewrites) and then closed the issue as informational. (Comment & close performed via `gh issue comment` and `gh issue close`.)
    5. Issues #21, #184, #185: each previously had diagnostic comments posted in earlier runs. No code changes possible from this session because:
       - #21 requires adding a repository secret (BRAVE_API_KEY) — maintainer action.
       - #184 and #185 require backend code/config changes — backend is marked read-only for this session.
    6. Confirmed local site builds successfully: `npm run build` → "2450 page(s) built" (build output; no changes required).
    7. No commits/PRs created because fixes required external access or backend changes. Returned to main branch (git checkout main).
  - Result: Closed issue #195 (informational). Posted/confirmed diagnostics on #21, #184, #185. Blockers remain: Cloudflare/hosting config and repository secret provisioning for BRAVE_API_KEY; backend code modifications require backend access & deployment.

- cron: gh-issues-autofix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 18:21 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git checkout main && git pull origin main (confirmed up-to-date: local main matches origin).
    2. Listed open PRs: `gh pr list --state open` → none.
    3. Listed open issues (gh issue list) and processed in priority order (P1-high, P1, P2): found open issues #21, #184, #185, #196, #197.
    4. For each issue:
       - Issue #21 (P1-high) — "chore(research): enable BRAVE_API_KEY":
         - Diagnosis: The Research PoC workflow is gated by the repository secret `BRAVE_API_KEY` (confirmed in `.github/workflows/research-poc.yml`). I verified `scripts/research_agent.py` exists but the workflow will not run until the secret is added.
         - Action: Posted diagnostic/blocker comment asking the maintainer to add `BRAVE_API_KEY` to repository secrets and how to re-run the workflow. (Comment created: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/21#issuecomment-4010570485)
       - Issue #184 (P2) — "Unauthenticated admin endpoint":
         - Diagnosis: `@app.post("/admin/refresh")` in `backend/api/main.py` registers an unauthenticated admin endpoint that calls `_refresh_data()` (confirmed in backend/api/main.py around the handler). This is a security/DoS risk.
         - Action: Posted diagnostic comment with remediation options (require API key, restrict to internal IPs, or gate behind env var). (Comment created: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/184#issuecomment-4010572245)
       - Issue #185 (P2) — "Rate-limiter memory leak":
         - Diagnosis: In-memory `rate_limits` dictionary grows because client keys are not removed after trimming timestamps (confirmed in backend/api/main.py: `rate_limits` definition and `check_rate_limit`).
         - Action: Posted diagnostic comment suggesting short-term fix (delete empty client keys) and long-term options (TTLCache or Redis). (Comment created: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/185#issuecomment-4010572646)
       - Issue #197 (uptime alert):
         - Diagnosis: Uptime monitor reported `https://api.pruviq.com/coins/stats` returned 503. I cannot access Cloudflare/origin logs from this environment.
         - Action: Posted a triage comment requesting Cloudflare/origin logs, deploy ID and reproduction check (`curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}\n" https://api.pruviq.com/coins/stats`). (Comment created: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/197#issuecomment-4010573407)
       - Issue #196 (uptime alert):
         - Diagnosis: Same as #197 — 503 from API reported by uptime monitor.
         - Action: Posted the same triage/ops request for logs and deploy metadata. (Comment created: https://github.com/pruviq/pruviq/issues/196#issuecomment-4010573661)
    5. Local verification: ran `npm run build` to ensure the static site builds — build completed successfully ("2450 page(s) built", build output: successful).
    6. Code changes: none committed. All actionable fixes are blocked by one of:
       - repository secret `BRAVE_API_KEY` (requires maintainer to add),
       - backend code changes (backend is read-only in this environment and requires backend maintainer to implement and deploy),
       - Cloudflare/hosting logs & deploy metadata (requires ops access).
    7. Updated MEMORY.md with this run summary and evidence (this entry).
  - Result: Diagnostic comments posted to issues #21, #184, #185, #196, #197. Build verification passed locally. Blockers recorded above.


- cron: gh-issues-autofix (autonomous run)
  - Time: 2026-03-06 22:19 KST
  - Actions performed:
    1. git checkout main && git pull origin main (confirmed up-to-date: output from git pull).
    2. Listed open PRs: found PRs #202 and #203. PR #203 required reviewer changes.
    3. Checked out branch fix/api-proxy-worker-2026-03-06 and implemented fixes:
       - public/_worker.js: limited the proxy rule to only match /api/* when there is a path after /api (regex /^\/api\/.+/), strip the /api prefix when forwarding, use fetch redirect:'manual', and added try/catch to return 502 JSON on upstream failures.
       - Restored MEMORY.md to origin/main to remove accidental changes.
       - Commit on branch: 987fe6d ("fix(proxy): only proxy /api/* with path and return redirects to client; remove accidental MEMORY.md edits (fixes PR #203 review)"). (confirmed via `git log origin/fix/api-proxy-worker-2026-03-06`)
       - Pushed branch to origin (git push completed).
       - Posted a comment on PR #203 describing the fix and requesting CI re-run.
    4. Ran npm run build locally after the change — build completed successfully (confirmed via `npm run build` output).
    5. Reviewed open issues and posted diagnostic/blocker comments where backend access or secrets are required:
       - Issue #204 (P0): added triage comment and reproduction check (curl); requested Cloudflare/origin logs and deploy IDs (blocked for ops access).
       - Issue #21 (P1): requested BRAVE_API_KEY secret be provisioned (blocked until secret added).
       - Issue #184 (P2): commented that /admin/refresh is unauthenticated and suggested adding ADMIN_KEY auth middleware.
       - Issue #185 (P2): pointed out rate_limits memory growth and proposed a patch (prune empty client keys or use TTLCache/Redis).
       - Issue #201 (P2) & #200 (P2): posted remediation suggestions for CORS and proxy-aware client IP handling.
    6. No other frontend-only issues identified that could be fixed from this environment. Many remaining issues require backend or ops changes.
  - Result:
    - Fixed PR #203 per reviewer feedback and pushed changes (commit 987fe6d). (CI for the branch has historical success runs; re-run requested.)
    - Posted diagnostic comments on high-priority issues requiring ops/backend action. Blockers: Cloudflare/origin logs, backend code changes (backend is read-only for this agent), and repository secret BRAVE_API_KEY.

    2. Listed open PRs: none requiring autofix (no open PRs with failing checks found).
    3. Listed open issues (gh issue list) and processed in priority order (P0 > P1 > P2):
       - #204 (P0-critical): added triage comment with reproduction checks and requested Cloudflare/origin logs (cannot access logs from this environment). (comment posted)
       - #206 (P1): attempted reproduction of reported 404 → could not reproduce (curl returned 200). Commented and requested edge/origin logs if it recurs. (comment posted)
       - #199, #198, #197, #196 (uptime alert duplicates): commented linking to #204 and closed each duplicate to reduce noise. (closed)
       - #207 (P2/general): implemented fix in frontend to emit a machine-readable last-modified meta tag and fallback Article JSON-LD dateModified (branch: fix/issue-207-add-last-modified-meta). Committed, built locally, pushed branch and opened PR #208. Local build evidence: "[build] 2450 page(s) built in 3.03s" (from `npm run build`).
       - #185, #184, #200, #201 (backend/security): inspected backend (backend/api/main.py) and posted diagnostic comments (rate limiter memory leak, unauthenticated admin endpoint, CORS allow_headers too-permissive, proxy-aware client IP handling). All require backend changes or ops access; cannot modify backend from this environment.
       - #21 (P1-high): research PoC requires BRAVE_API_KEY repo secret; posted blocker comment explaining how to provision the secret (cannot add secrets from here).
    4. Local verification: ran `npm run build` to validate frontend changes — build succeeded: "[build] 2450 page(s) built in 3.03s" (confirmed in build output).
    5. Pushed branch fix/issue-207-add-last-modified-meta and created PR #208 (fixes #207).
    6. Updated MEMORY.md with this run summary (this entry).
  - Result: One frontend fix implemented & PR opened (#208). Several issues triaged and commented. Blockers (require maintainer/ops): Cloudflare/origin logs (for 5xx uptime), backend code changes (rate limiter/admin endpoint/CORS), and repository secret BRAVE_API_KEY.
