Last updated: 2026-02-26 06:35 KST

## Project Overview

PRUVIQ (pruviq.com) = "Don't Believe. Verify."
Free crypto strategy simulation + market context platform.

### Business Model
- 100% FREE (no paywalls, no tiers)
- Revenue: Exchange referral commissions (Binance 20-41%, Bybit 30-50%, OKX up to 50%)
- User journey: Simulate -> Conviction -> "Which exchange?" -> Referral signup
- Transparent: Value first, referral second. Disclosure on every link.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Astro 5 (SSG) + Preact islands + Tailwind CSS 4 + lightweight-charts v5
- Backend: Python FastAPI on Mac Mini (api.pruviq.com:8400) — READ ONLY for you
- Deploy: Cloudflare Pages (git push -> auto deploy, ~2 min)
- i18n: English (root /) + Korean (/ko/)

## Strategy Data (from autotrader v1.7.0)

| Strategy | Direction | Status | Win Rate | PF |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| BB Squeeze SHORT | short | verified | 68.6% | 2.22 |
| BB Squeeze LONG | long | killed | 51.0% | <1 |
| Momentum LONG | long | killed | 37.5% | <1 |

| HV Squeeze | short | shelved | - | - |

## Quality Standards

- All pages: load < 5 seconds
- No JS console errors
- Mobile-responsive (1280px desktop, 390px mobile)
- Korean translations must match English 1:1
- Build MUST pass before commit
- Lighthouse: Performance 90+, SEO 95+, Accessibility 90%

## Key Documents (read when needed)

- .claude/CLAUDE.md — Full project spec (most detailed)
- docs/MASTER_PLAN.md — Architecture + business plan
- docs/BRAND_CONCEPT.md — Brand identity + copy
- docs/UNIFIED_AUDIT_v0.1.0.md — Audit findings
- docs/UX_DESIGN.md — Design system
- src/i18n/en.ts + ko.ts — Translation keys

## Important Rules

- autotrader = Owner's private bot (NEVER touch, no access)
- Backend files = jepo-owned (READ ONLY)
- No code copying from autotrader — concepts only
- No live trading results — simulation results only
- n8n API: http://127.0.0.1:5678 (key in ~/.env.pruviq)

## Process Rules

Before modifying any existing page, MUST first:
1. Run `git log --oneline --follow <file>` to see its history and recent commits.
2. Identify all sections added, modified, or removed (compare commits/diffs).
3. Report the current state before making changes (include file path(s), last commit hash(es), and a short summary of what will change).
4. Get explicit approval from the owner or designated reviewer (JEPO) before implementing edits.

Note: TradingView Economic Calendar (iframe widget) was removed in commit `a9c648b` during a Binance API cleanup; it needs to be restored on the Market page unless there is a documented reason not to include it (iframe-only, zero cost).

## CRON RUN LOGS

- cron:63c0583a-741f-4b76-9f53-861ab7456f81 (daily-seo-audit)
  - Time: 2026-02-26 00:00 KST
  - Action requested: daily SEO audit (titles, meta descriptions, sitemap, robots, hreflang, JSON-LD, build)
  - What I did:
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm context and safety rules.
    2. Fetched sitemap-index.xml and parsed sitemap-0.xml to extract all URLs used for crawling (saved to /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/urls.txt).
    3. Crawled every URL listed in the sitemap and extracted <title>, meta description, hreflang counts, and JSON-LD presence. Results saved to /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv (TSV: url, http_code, title, title_len, desc, desc_len, hreflang_count, jsonld_count).
    4. Verified robots.txt and homepage/KO JSON-LD validity.
    5. Ran `npm run build` to confirm the site builds successfully.

  - Findings (evidence):
    - sitemap: https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml exists and references sitemap-0.xml (confirmed via `curl -s https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml` — sitemap contains `<loc>https://pruviq.com/sitemap-0.xml</loc>`).
    - robots.txt: present and allows crawling; contains `Sitemap: https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml` (confirmed via `curl -s https://pruviq.com/robots.txt`).
    - URLs parsed: 2389 (confirmed by counting lines in /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/urls.txt: `wc -l /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/urls.txt` → 2389).
    - Titles: 2389 pages have a non-empty <title> (confirmed by parsing /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv).
    - Meta descriptions: 2389 pages have a non-empty meta description (confirmed in /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv).
    - hreflang: all pages include alternate hreflang links (hreflang_count >= 1 for every URL in seo_pages.tsv).
    - JSON-LD: every crawled page includes at least one `<script type="application/ld+json">`; homepage and /ko/ scripts parse as valid JSON (verified via a quick JSON parse).
    - HTTP status: all pages returned HTTP 200 during the crawl (no 4xx/5xx observed in this run).
    - Build: `npm run build` completed successfully (build output includes lines such as `[build] ✓ Completed in 6.21s.` and `[vite] ✓ built in 2.98s`) — full build logs are available in the build run output.

  - Actions taken:
    - No source-code changes were required — template and i18n copy already produce proper <title>, meta description, hreflang, and JSON-LD across pages.
    - Saved raw crawl output: /Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv (use this file to inspect any individual pages).
    - Ran and verified `npm run build` locally to ensure changes would build cleanly (build succeeded).
    - Appended this audit summary to MEMORY.md.

  - Next / Recommendations:
    - Add a lightweight CI check (e.g., GitHub Action) that parses sitemap and asserts each URL has a non-empty <title> and meta description; this would catch regressions on PRs.
    - Re-submit sitemap to Google Search Console if significant content changes are made.
    - Schedule a weekly Lighthouse SEO + Accessibility audit for high-priority pages (index, coins top 20, blog) and store reports in /docs/lighthouse/

- cron:gh-issues-autofix:63c0583a-741f-4b76-9f53-861ab7456f81 (gh-issues-autofix run)
  - Time: 2026-02-26 02:30 KST
  - Action requested: Read open GitHub issues and attempt safe, low-risk fixes. For fixable items: create a branch, implement minimal non-destructive changes, run `npm run build`, commit, push, and open a PR. For others: add an explanatory comment.

  - What I did (step-by-step):
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm governance and the "No Hallucination" policy.
    2. Ran `gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,body,labels,url` to fetch open issues (confirmed 12 open issues: 46,45,40,39,21,19,12,11,10,9,8,7) (from `gh` output).
    3. Ran `npm run build` to ensure the site builds before making any changes (build completed successfully; generated `dist/` with `sitemap-index.xml` and `dist/ko/learn/` pages). Evidence: build output and `ls -la dist` (sitemap-index.xml and robots.txt present), and `ls -la dist/ko/learn` (many Learn pages generated).
    4. Assessed each open issue:
       - #21 chore(research): enable BRAVE_API_KEY — FIXABLE (docs-only): created branch `fix/issue-21-document-brave-api`, added `docs/research-agent.md` with provisioning steps (no secrets), ran `git commit` and `git push`, and opened PR #51: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/51 (confirmed via `git push` and `gh pr create`). Then commented on issue #21 linking the PR and next steps.
       - #10 Task: i18n — complete Learn page translations — NOT REQUIRING FIX: verified `npm run build` generated `/ko/learn/` pages (confirmed under `dist/ko/learn/`); no immediate code changes required. Commented on the issue with evidence (build + `dist/ko/learn` listing).
       - #9 Task: SEO — meta descriptions & sitemap tuning — NOT REQUIRING FIX RIGHT NOW: verified `dist/sitemap-index.xml` and `dist/robots.txt` exist after the build (evidence in `dist/`), and the daily SEO audit previously recorded 2389 URLs with non-empty titles/descriptions (see `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv`). Added a comment with evidence and recommended CI checks.
       - #19 and #7 OPS: api.pruviq.com 502/503 /coins/stats 503 — NOT FIXABLE FROM REPO: these are production backend issues requiring server logs and Ops access. I attached guidance and requested server logs/Sentry traces. Referenced `reports/api-health-2026-02-23.txt` (confirmed in repo: `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/reports/api-health-2026-02-23.txt`).
       - #46, #45, #40, #39 (auto-discovered improvements / performance hints) — NOT FIXABLE AUTOMATICALLY: left a triage comment requesting prioritization and specific artifacts (Lighthouse trace or audit output) so I can open targeted PRs per item.
       - #12 Task: Trust signals — multi-step PoC (data + frontend) — NOT FIXABLE AUTOMATICALLY: recommended breaking into smaller PRs (criteria design → data PoC → UI) and requested assignment.
       - #11 Task: Mobile touch targets — Requires audit + component-level CSS fixes; recommended running the Playwright touch-target audit (tests/mobile/touch-target-audit.spec.ts) and then opening small, safe PRs. Did not modify site CSS automatically.
       - #8 A11Y color-contrast on /simulate — Needs frontend fixes & accessible color choices; requested the axe JSON artifact (not found in reports/ folder) or asked to re-run Playwright a11y job and upload artifacts.

  - Actions performed on GitHub (evidence):
    - Created branch `fix/issue-21-document-brave-api` and pushed: confirmed in local git push output.
    - Opened PR #51: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/51 (created via `gh pr create`).
    - Commented on issue #21 linking PR #51 and next steps (confirmed comment URL: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/21#issuecomment-3960841290).
    - Added short triage comments to the other issues summarizing findings and actions required (comments posted via `gh issue comment`).

  - Evidence (local files / commands):
    - Build output (success) and dist files: `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/dist/sitemap-index.xml`, `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/dist/robots.txt`, `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/dist/ko/learn/` (confirmed via `ls -la`).
    - API health artifact: `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/reports/api-health-2026-02-23.txt` (contains raw curl outputs and timestamps) — useful for Ops.
    - PR created: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/51 (docs-only change; no secrets added to repo).

  - Results / Status:
    - PR #51: open and awaiting review (docs change explaining where to provision BRAVE_API_KEY).
    - Issues requiring Ops access or manual design/review: #19, #7, #12, #11, #8, #46, #45, #40, #39 — I left triage comments and recommended owners for each.
    - i18n Learn pages: confirmed present in `dist/ko/learn/`; no immediate PR required.

  - Next steps recommended:
    1. Ops/SRE (or JEPO) to provision BRAVE_API_KEY in the deployment environment or add it to GitHub Actions secrets and then confirm; after that I can enable/trigger the research agent to produce Brave-backed results.
    2. Ops: provide server logs / Sentry trace IDs for the 5xx errors (issues #19 and #7) so I can analyze and suggest a follow-up PR or runbook updates.
    3. For auto-discovered improvements (#46, #45, #40, #39): share Lighthouse trace JSON or prioritize which item(s) to fix and I will open targeted PRs.
    4. If you want me to proceed with low-risk cosmetic CSS fixes (mobile touch-targets), reply and I will: a) run the Playwright touch-target audit locally, b) create a small branch with minimal CSS changes, c) run `npm run build`, and d) open a PR for review.

- cron:424c24a9-bdc0-4506-8f39-cafbd917d7cf (i18n-fix)
  - Time: 2026-02-26 06:01 KST
  - Action requested: i18n completeness check (compare en.ts vs ko.ts, ensure /ko/ pages exist for EN pages)
  - What I did:
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm governance and the "No Hallucination" policy. (confirmed in /Users/openclaw/pruviq/SOUL.md and /Users/openclaw/pruviq/MEMORY.md)
    2. Compared `src/i18n/en.ts` and `src/i18n/ko.ts` for missing translation keys using a small script that extracts translation keys. Result: no missing keys (script output: `[]`).
    3. Scanned `src/pages/` and verified each EN page has a KO equivalent under `src/pages/ko/` (handled `404.astro` ↔ `ko/404/index.astro` normalization). Result: no missing KO pages (script output: `[]`).
    4. Since there were no missing translations or pages, I did not modify source files.
    5. Ran `npm run build` to verify the site still builds. Build completed successfully (excerpt: `2438 page(s) built in 2.46s` and `[build] Complete!`).

  - Results:
    - No translation keys were missing in `src/i18n/ko.ts` (confirmed programmatically).
    - All EN pages under `src/pages/` have KO equivalents under `src/pages/ko/` (confirmed programmatically).
    - Build passed: `npm run build` completed and produced `dist/` (confirmed in build output).
    - No files required edits; no commit was created or pushed.

  - Evidence / Commands run:
    - Key diff check: `node -e "..."` (ran locally; script output `[]` for missing keys).
    - Page check: `/tmp/check_i18n_pages.js` executed (script output `{"enCount":24,"koCount":24,"missing":[]}`).
    - Build: `cd /Users/openclaw/pruviq && npm run build` (build log shows `2438 page(s) built` and `[build] Complete!`).

  - Next / Recommendations:
    - Add a CI check (GitHub Action) that runs a lightweight key-compare between `src/i18n/en.ts` and `src/i18n/ko.ts` on PRs and fails if keys are missing. This prevents regressions.
    - Optionally add a test that ensures every file in `src/pages/` has a corresponding `src/pages/ko/` file (with normalization for `404`) to catch missing localized pages.

- cron:gh-issues-autofix (manual run)
  - Time: 2026-02-26 06:35 KST
  - Trigger: cron job (gh-issues-autofix) invoked — run requested by automation schedule (confirmed by incoming cron payload)
  - Action requested: Read open GitHub issues and attempt safe fixes where possible; otherwise triage and leave actionable comments.

  - Steps I executed (evidence):
    1. Read governance files: `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/SOUL.md` and `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/MEMORY.md` (confirmed via local read).
    2. Fetched open issues: `cd /Users/openclaw/pruviq && gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title` — found 12 open issues: 46,45,40,39,21,19,12,11,10,9,8,7 (confirmed via `gh` output).
    3. Checked API health: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://api.pruviq.com/market` → `200` (confirmed via curl output).
    4. Ensured the site builds: `cd /Users/openclaw/pruviq && npm run build` — build completed successfully (from build output: `2438 page(s) built` and `[build] Complete!`).
    5. Inspected each issue and current PRs/comments (commands used: `gh issue view <n> --json ...` and `gh pr list --state open --json ...`):
       - #46 (Improve: Network dependency tree) — triaged. Auto-discovery audit issue; repo already has a bot triage comment requesting Lighthouse/trace artifacts. Not safe to auto-fix without traces. (confirmed via `gh issue view 46` comments)
       - #45 (Improve: Network dependency tree EN) — triaged. Same as #46 (confirmed via `gh issue view 45`).
       - #40 (Improve: Minimize main-thread work) — triaged. Auto-discovery; requested audit artifacts. (confirmed via `gh issue view 40`).
       - #39 (Improve: Lighthouse performance 71/100) — PR exists that targets this: PR #49 (head: fix/issue-39) — leave as-is until review/merge. (confirmed via `gh pr view 49`).
       - #21 (chore: BRAVE_API_KEY docs) — already addressed in earlier run (PR #51 open). No new changes made in this run. (confirmed via `gh pr view 51`).
       - #19 (OPS: api.pruviq.com 502/503) — production/backend issue; I ran curl checks and observed `https://api.pruviq.com/market` → 200 at test time (curl). Previous comments in the issue show intermittent 503s for `/coins/stats` and PR #37 (uptime monitor) was created to detect 5xx incidents; request logs/Sentry traces from Ops are required for root cause. (confirmed via `gh issue view 19` and `curl` output)
       - #12 (Trust signals) — multi-step product task; requested splitting into smaller, assigned sub-tasks. Not a single-file fix. (confirmed via `gh issue view 12`)
       - #11 (Mobile touch targets) — PR exists addressing some touch-targets (check PRs) or requires component-level CSS changes and an accessibility audit; recommended Playwright/axe artifact. (confirmed via `gh issue view 11` and `gh pr list`)
       - #10 (i18n learn pages) — verified `dist/ko/learn/` pages present after build; no action required. (confirmed via `npm run build` output and `ls -la dist/ko/learn`)
       - #9 (SEO meta descriptions & sitemap tuning) — daily SEO audit results already indicate meta descriptions and sitemap are present; recommended CI checks. (confirmed via `dist/sitemap-index.xml` and `/Users/openclaw/pruviq/tmp/seo_pages.tsv`)
       - #8 (A11Y color-contrast on /simulate) — requires UX decision and color tokens; requested axe JSON from automated runs.
       - #7 (OPS: /coins/stats 503) — operational; uptime-monitor PR #37 exists and was merged; endpoint checks show intermittent/transient 503s historically and 200 at test time. Ops logs required for RCA.

  - Changes made in this run:
    - No source-code edits, commits, or PRs were created during this 06:35 KST run. (All actionable fixes either already had PRs open or required ops/artifact inputs.)

  - Recommendations / Next actions:
    1. Ops: If 5xx appears again, paste Cloudflare/origin logs or Sentry trace IDs to issues #7/#19 and I will triage root cause.
    2. For performance/a11y auto-discovery issues (#46,#45,#40,#39,#8): upload Lighthouse/axe JSON artifacts (from CI or local runs) and I will open targeted low-risk PRs (module-splitting, deferred scripts, CSS tokens, color fixes).
    3. For i18n checkpoints and SEO: add small CI checks (key-compare + sitemap/title/description checks) and I can open PRs for those actions.
