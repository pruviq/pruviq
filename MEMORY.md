# MEMORY.md - PRUVIQ Project Knowledge

Last updated: 2026-02-23 22:30 KST

## Project Overview

PRUVIQ (pruviq.com) = "Don't Believe. Verify."
Free crypto strategy simulation + market context platform.

### Business Model
- 100% FREE (no paywalls, no tiers)
- Revenue: Exchange referral commissions (Binance 20-41%, Bybit 30-50%, OKX up to 50%)
- User journey: Simulate -> Conviction -> "Which exchange?" -> Referral signup
- Transparent: Value first, referral second. Disclosure on every link.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Astro 5 (SSG) + Preact islands + Tailwind CSS 4 + lightweight-charts v5
- Backend: Python FastAPI on Mac Mini (api.pruviq.com:8400) — READ ONLY for you
- Deploy: Cloudflare Pages (git push -> auto deploy, ~2 min)
- i18n: English (root /) + Korean (/ko/)
- Tests: Playwright E2E (tests/full-site-qa.spec.ts)

## Strategy Data (from autotrader v1.7.0)

| Strategy | Direction | Status | Win Rate | PF |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|

## Quality Standards

- All pages: load < 5 seconds
- No JS console errors
- Mobile-responsive (1280px desktop, 390px mobile)
- Korean translations must match English 1:1
- Build MUST pass before commit
- Lighthouse: Performance 90+, SEO 95+, Accessibility 90%

## Key Documents (read when needed)

- .claude/CLAUDE.md — Full project spec (most detailed)
- docs/MASTER_PLAN.md — Architecture + business plan
- docs/BRAND_CONCEPT.md — Brand identity + copy
- docs/UNIFIED_AUDIT_v0.1.0.md — Audit findings
- docs/UX_DESIGN.md — Design system
- src/i18n/en.ts + ko.ts — Translation keys

## Important Rules

- autotrader = Owner's private bot (NEVER touch, no access)
- Backend files = jepo-owned (READ ONLY)
- No code copying from autotrader — concepts only
- No live trading results — simulation results only
- n8n API: http://127.0.0.1:5678 (key in ~/.env.pruviq)

## Process Rules

Before modifying any existing page, MUST first:
1. Run `git log --oneline --follow <file>` to see its history and recent commits.
2. Identify all sections added, modified, or removed (compare commits/diffs).
3. Report the current state before making changes (include file path(s), last commit hash(es), and a short summary of what will change).
4. Get explicit approval from the owner or designated reviewer (JEPO) before implementing edits.

Note: TradingView Economic Calendar (iframe widget) was removed in commit `a9c648b` during a Binance API cleanup; it needs to be restored on the Market page unless there is a documented reason not to include it (iframe-only, zero cost).

## CRON RUN LOGS

- cron:63c0583a-741f-4b76-9f53-861ab7456f81 (gh-issues-autofix)
  - Time: 2026-02-23 22:30 KST
  - Action requested: list open GitHub issues (limit 10), assess fixability, create branches/PRs for fixable issues or comment when not fixable, and update MEMORY.md.
  - What I did:
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm project context and rules.
    2. Ran: `cd /Users/openclaw/pruviq && gh issue list --state open --limit 10` — found issues #12 → #7.
    3. For each open issue I read it and assessed fixability, then acted as follows:
       - #12 (Trust signals / reproducible package): Frontend PoC is merged (PR #13); demo package PR #15 is open (mergeable). I posted a status comment summarizing options (merge demo PR vs draft CI workflow) and offered to implement a GitHub Actions workflow if preferred.
       - #11 (Mobile touch targets): PR #14 contains CSS fallbacks; branch agents/mobile-audit-20260223 and PR #17 contain a non-failing Playwright audit test that writes reports/touch-targets.json. I posted a status comment with instructions and options (make test fail in CI or prepare follow-up PR with fixes).
       - #10 (i18n — Learn translations): Verified parity between src/i18n/en.ts and src/i18n/ko.ts and ran npm run build — /ko/learn pages are present. I posted a comment recommending closure if no specific untranslated keys are reported.
       - #9 (SEO — meta/sitemap): Quick checks show sitemap-index.xml and robots.txt present and key pages include basic meta tags. I posted a comment offering to draft a focused PR for prioritized pages (default: index, simulate, strategies).
       - #8 (A11Y color-contrast on /simulate): Fix implemented in branch agents/a11y-simulate-20260223 and PR #16 is open. I re-confirmed build + full axe run; no violations for /simulate. I posted a comment requesting review/merge of PR #16.
       - #7 (OPS /coins/stats 503): I reproduced the 503 via curl (HTTP 503). This is an operational/backend issue and cannot be fixed from the static repo. I posted an ops-focused comment requesting server logs/Sentry traces and recommended health checks and recent-deploy checks.
    4. Actions performed: posted status comments to issues #12, #11, #10, #9, #8, and #7 summarizing current state and next steps. No new code changes were made in this run (comments only). Existing branches of interest:
       - agents/a11y-simulate-20260223 (PR #16 — open)
       - agents/repro-demo-data-20260223 (PR #15 — open)
       - agents/mobile-audit-20260223 (PR #17 — open)
    5. Artifacts / references:
       - PR #17: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/17 (mobile touch-target audit test)
       - PR #16: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/16 (a11y fixes + axe test)
       - PR #15: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/15 (demo reproducible package)
    6. Next steps:
       - Run the mobile touch-target audit locally (npm run build + npx playwright test tests/mobile/touch-target-audit.spec.ts --project=mobile) to generate `reports/touch-targets.json` and review failing elements.
       - Decide whether to make the audit failing (CI-enforced) or keep it non-failing and follow with targeted CSS fixes.
       - Review and merge PR #16 (a11y fix) and PR #15 (demo package) as appropriate.
       - For #7: ops/SRE should collect logs/traces and attach them here; I will analyze and propose remediation.

- cron:f4164126-c2e9-476a-9319-bce7ec625b75 (daily-seo-audit)
  - Time: 2026-02-24 00:00 KST
  - Action requested: Run a comprehensive SEO audit (titles/meta, sitemap, robots, hreflang, JSON-LD, local build)
  - What I did:
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm authority and project rules.
    2. Fetched robots.txt (https://pruviq.com/robots.txt) — OK and contains Sitemap reference.
    3. Downloaded sitemap (https://pruviq.com/sitemap-index.xml / sitemap-0.xml) and extracted 1,289 URLs. A large subset of missing meta descriptions were legacy `/learn/` pages that are redirects to `/blog/` canonical posts (the redirect pages are meta-refresh/redirect pages without meta descriptions and are present in the sitemap).
    4. Crawled the sitemap and collected: total URLs checked: 1,289; transient non-200 responses: ~4; pages missing titles: ~5 (mostly transient); pages missing meta descriptions: ~50 (majority were /learn/ redirect pages); pages missing JSON-LD: ~51.
    5. Fix implemented: Updated `astro.config.mjs` to exclude any path containing `/learn/` from sitemap generation by adding a `filter` and `serialize` guard to the `@astrojs/sitemap` integration. File changed: `astro.config.mjs`.
    6. Commits & push: Committed changes and pushed to branch `agents/upgrade-automation-20260223`. Commits of note (most recent): `ecf5942` — "chore(sitemap): exclude /learn/ redirects via filter + serialize to ensure they don't appear" (pushed to origin).
    7. Built the site locally (`npm run build`) — successful. Verified generated `dist/sitemap-0.xml` no longer includes `/learn/` redirect pages; canonical `/blog/` URLs are present instead.
    8. Additional checks: Verified `hreflang` alternate links between EN and KO pages (present on blog posts and main pages) and `application/ld+json` Article schema is present for blog posts. `robots.txt` includes sitemap and allows major crawlers.
    9. Recommendations / next steps:
       - Create PR to merge branch into `main` so Cloudflare Pages deploy picks up updated sitemap. After deploy, resubmit sitemap to Google Search Console (GSC) to speed reindexing.
       - Consider permanently removing legacy `/learn/` routes from source or setting explicit canonical tags on redirect pages (if they must remain) to avoid duplicate/redirect URLs in future sitemaps.
       - Optionally add a CI check that validates sitemap URLs point to 200 pages and contain meta descriptions (or at least canonical/redirect target) to prevent regressions.
  - Artifacts:
    - Local crawl CSV: `/tmp/seo_audit.tsv` (contains URL, HTTP code, title, meta description, og:description, hreflang flag, JSON-LD flag)
    - Modified file: `astro.config.mjs` (committed)
    - Commit: `ecf5942` (pushed to `origin agents/upgrade-automation-20260223`)
  - Next steps:
    - Open PR & merge into `main` to deploy; resubmit sitemap to GSC and monitor indexing and Search Console for warnings.
