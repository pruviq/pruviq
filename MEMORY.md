# MEMORY.md - PRUVIQ Project Knowledge

Last updated: 2026-02-24 03:59 KST

## Project Overview

PRUVIQ (pruviq.com) = "Don't Believe. Verify."
Free crypto strategy simulation + market context platform.

### Business Model
- 100% FREE (no paywalls, no tiers)
- Revenue: Exchange referral commissions (Binance 20-41%, Bybit 30-50%, OKX up to 50%)
- User journey: Simulate -> Conviction -> "Which exchange?" -> Referral signup
- Transparent: Value first, referral second. Disclosure on every link.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Astro 5 (SSG) + Preact islands + Tailwind CSS 4 + lightweight-charts v5
- Backend: Python FastAPI on Mac Mini (api.pruviq.com:8400) — READ ONLY for you
- Deploy: Cloudflare Pages (git push -> auto deploy, ~2 min)
- i18n: English (root /) + Korean (/ko/)
- Tests: Playwright E2E (tests/full-site-qa.spec.ts)

## Current State (v0.2.0)

### Audit Results (2026-02-18, 6-agent audit)
| Item | Score | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Trust signals | 4/10 | needs work |
| SEO/indexing | 6/10 | GSC registered, awaiting |
| i18n completeness | 5/10 | P1 |

- Mobile UX (touch targets 44px, loading states)
- Trust signals improvement

### All P0 issues RESOLVED
See docs/UNIFIED_AUDIT_v0.1.0.md for details.

## Strategy Data (from autotrader v1.7.0)

| Strategy | Direction | Status | Win Rate | PF |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| BB Squeeze SHORT | short | verified | 68.6% | 2.22 |
| BB Squeeze LONG | long | killed | 51.0% | <1 |
| Momentum LONG | long | killed | 37.5% | <1 |
| ATR Breakout | long | shelved | - | - |
| HV Squeeze | short | shelved | - | - |

## Quality Standards

- All pages: load < 5 seconds
- No JS console errors
- Mobile-responsive (1280px desktop, 390px mobile)
- Korean translations must match English 1:1
- Build MUST pass before commit
- Lighthouse: Performance 90+, SEO 95+, Accessibility 90%

## Key Documents (read when needed)

- .claude/CLAUDE.md — Full project spec (most detailed)
- docs/MASTER_PLAN.md — Architecture + business plan
- docs/BRAND_CONCEPT.md — Brand identity + copy
- docs/UNIFIED_AUDIT_v0.1.0.md — Audit findings
- docs/UX_DESIGN.md — Design system
- src/i18n/en.ts + ko.ts — Translation keys

## Important Rules

- autotrader = Owner's private bot (NEVER touch, no access)
- Backend files = jepo-owned (READ ONLY)
- No code copying from autotrader — concepts only
- No live trading results — simulation results only
- n8n API: http://127.0.0.1:5678 (key in ~/.env.pruviq)

## Process Rules

Before modifying any existing page, MUST first:
1. Run `git log --oneline --follow <file>` to see its history and recent commits.
2. Identify all sections added, modified, or removed (compare commits/diffs).
3. Report the current state before making changes (include file path(s), last commit hash(es), and a short summary of what will change).
4. Get explicit approval from the owner or designated reviewer (JEPO) before implementing edits.

Note: TradingView Economic Calendar (iframe widget) was removed in commit `a9c648b` during a Binance API cleanup; it needs to be restored on the Market page unless there is a documented reason not to include it (iframe-only, zero cost).

## CRON RUN LOGS

- cron:63c0583a-741f-4b76-9f53-861ab7456f81 (gh-issues-autofix)
  - Time: 2026-02-24 02:30 KST
  - Action requested: list open GitHub issues (limit 10), assess fixability, create branches/PRs for fixable issues or comment when not fixable, and update MEMORY.md.
  - What I did:
    1. Read SOUL.md and MEMORY.md to confirm project context and rules.
    2. Ran: `cd /Users/openclaw/pruviq && gh issue list --state open --limit 10` — found issues #21, #19, #12 → #7.
    3. For each open issue I read it and assessed fixability, then acted as follows:
       - #21 (chore/research: enable BRAVE_API_KEY): This requires provisioning a secret (BRAVE_API_KEY) to CI/Gateway/Cloudflare Pages. I cannot set secrets from the repo. I posted a status comment explaining where to add the secret (GitHub Actions secret or Cloudflare env) and offered to draft a small workflow demo or re-run the research PoC after the secret is provisioned. (Comment URL: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/21#issuecomment-3946213197)
       - #19 (OPS: api.pruviq.com returning 502/503): Operational issue. I posted an ops runbook-style comment requesting server logs, Sentry traces, and host-level checks (journalctl, ss, local health endpoint) and offered to analyze artifacts if provided. (Comment URL: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/19#issuecomment-3946214024)
       - #12 (Trust signals / reproducible package): Frontend PoC merged (PR #13). Demo reproducible package PR #15 open (mergeable). I previously posted options (merge demo PR vs draft CI for reproducible packages).
       - #11 (Mobile touch targets): PR #14 adds CSS fallbacks; PR #17 adds a non-failing Playwright touch-target audit (writes reports/touch-targets.json). I previously opened PR #17 (agents/mobile-audit-20260223). Next step: run audit and patch elements <44x44 or enforce via CI.
       - #10 (i18n Learn pages): Verified parity between src/i18n/en.ts and src/i18n/ko.ts; /ko/learn pages are generated by build — no code changes required.
       - #9 (SEO): sitemap-index.xml and robots.txt present; I offered to draft a focused PR updating meta descriptions for prioritized pages (index, simulate, strategies).
       - #8 (A11Y /simulate): Fixed in branch agents/a11y-simulate-20260223; PR #16 is open (a11y fixes + axe test). Build + full axe run reported no violations for /simulate. I requested review/merge of PR #16.
       - #7 (OPS /coins/stats 503): I reproduced 503 via curl. Ops/SRE must collect logs/Sentry traces and investigate; cannot be fixed from the static repo.
    4. Actions performed: posted status comments to issues #21 and #19 (new), and reconfirmed/updated comments on existing issues #12, #11, #10, #9, #8, #7. No new code changes were made in this run (comments only).
    5. Artifacts / references:
       - PR #17: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/17 (mobile touch-target audit test)
       - PR #16: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/16 (a11y fixes + axe test)
       - PR #15: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/15 (demo reproducible package)
       - PR #20: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/20 (agents/upgrade-automation-20260223)
    6. Next steps:
       - Provision BRAVE_API_KEY as a secret (Actions/Cloudflare/Gateway) or assign to ops to set it; I will re-run the research PoC after it's set.
       - Run the mobile touch-target audit locally or in CI to generate `reports/touch-targets.json` and review failing elements.
       - Review & merge PR #16 (a11y fixes) and PR #15 (demo package) as appropriate.
       - For #19/#7: ops/SRE should collect logs/traces and attach them here; I will analyze and propose remediation.

       - #11 (Mobile touch targets): PR #14 (CSS touch-target fixes) and PR #17 (Playwright touch-target audit) are open. I posted guidance to merge the audit PR first to generate the report and then follow up with targeted fixes. (Comment: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/11#issuecomment-3947469492)
       - #10 (i18n — Learn translations): Verified parity again between src/i18n/en.ts and src/i18n/ko.ts and confirmed build emits /ko/learn pages; recommended closing the issue if there are no specific untranslated keys. (Comment: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/10#issuecomment-3947470523)
       - #9 (SEO — meta descriptions & sitemap tuning): Created a branch and draft PR to make quick SEO copy improvements (index/strategies/meta desc). Branch: `agents/seo-meta-20260224`, PR #22 created (draft). Built locally; build succeeded. (PR: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/pull/22). Also posted a comment on the issue. (Comment: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/9#issuecomment-3947471794)
       - #8 (A11Y /simulate): PR #16 is open and fixes color-contrast violations; the PR includes an axe test and the author reports no violations for /simulate after changes. Recommended review/merge of PR #16. (Comment: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/8#issuecomment-3947471406)
       - #7 (OPS /coins/stats 503): I re-tested /coins/stats (https://api.pruviq.com/coins/stats) — returned 200 at test time. Posted an ops comment requesting logs/traces if the error recurs. (Comment: https://github.com/poong92/pruviq/issues/7#issuecomment-3947466794)
    4. Code changes performed in this run:
       - Created branch `agents/seo-meta-20260224` and updated translation files:
         - src/i18n/en.ts — updated meta.home_desc, meta.index_desc, meta.strategies_desc

    3. Actions taken per issue:
       - #21 (chore/research: enable BRAVE_API_KEY): Not fixable from the repo — BRAVE_API_KEY must be provisioned as a secret or environment variable by a repo/org admin (GitHub Actions secret or Cloudflare Pages env). I posted a status comment with provisioning instructions and offered to draft a workflow that uses the secret once available.
